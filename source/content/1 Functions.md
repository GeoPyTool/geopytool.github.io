|Loading any picture as base map|Both X-Y plot and triangular diagram is supported, that means users can use any picture form any articles as their base map to plot data on and generate their diagram even it has not been contained by any other softwares.|An original function|
|Fit and Contour map supported in X-Y plot| Any picture can be imported as base map, and the data can be poly fitted and drawn with contour map.|An original function|
|Multi Dimensional data Visualization and Statistics|Data with more than three dimensions can be imported and statistical processed to be used on a 3-D Visualization. |An original function|
